                    I had joined CultureX as frontend intern where my job was to
                    transform <icons.figma /> designs into production ready UI with
                    <icons.reactjs />
                </p>
                <p class="relative pl-3 mb-4">
                    <BulletPoint />
                    After my internship period my role was converted to full-time
                    developer and i took majority of frontend codebase's responsibility.

                    <BulletPoint />
                    I migrated company's two <icons.reactjs text="CRA" /> (create-react-app)
                    projects to <icons.vite /> and increased development build speed
                    by 10-100x and production build speed by 2x

                    <BulletPoint />
                    I migrated project from <icons.bootstrap /> to <icons.tailwind
                    /> which allowed us to develop UI at much faster pace & also
                    allowed us to use tailwind dependent UI solutions like <icons.shadcn
                    />
                </p>

                    I created a micro-service to generate PDF file by leveraging
                    packages like <icons.puppeteer /> & <icons.reactjs /> which looks
                    like
